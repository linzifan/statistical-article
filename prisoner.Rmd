### Description

The director of a prison offers 100 prisoners on death row, which are numbered from 1 to 100, a last chance. In a room there is a cupboard with 100 drawers. The director puts in each drawer the number of exactly one prisoner in random order and cloese the drawers afterwards. The prisoners enter the room one after another. Each prisoner may open and look into 50 drawers in any order and the drawers are closed again afterwards. In during this search every prisoner finds his number in one of the drawers, all prisoner are pardoned. If just one prisoner does not find his number, all prisoners have to die. Before the first prisoner enters the room, the prisoners may discuss their strategy, afterwards no communication of any means is possible. *What is the best strategy for the prisoners?*

### Strategy

The key to success is that the prisoners do not have to decide beforehand which drawers they are going to open. Each prisoner can use the information gained from the contents of previously opened drawers to help him decide which drawer to open next. The success of one prisoner is not independent of the success of the other prisoners.

In order to describe the strategy, not only the prisoners, but also the drawers are numbered from 1 to 100.
1. Each prisoner first opens the drawer with his own number.
2. If this drawer contains his number he is finised with his search and was successful.
3. Otherwise, the drawer contains the number of another prisoner and he next opens the drawer with this number.
4. The prisoner repeats steps 2 and 3 until he finds his own number or has opened 50 drawers.
This approach ensures that every time a prisoner opens a drawer he either finds his own number or the number of another prisoner he has not encountered so far.
